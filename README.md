## ‚ùì About

FlockBot is a new fully customizable, multi-purpose Discord bot. You can invite it to your Discord server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=799430695335493643&permissions=8&scope=applications.commands%20bot)! Also, you can join the official [FlockBot Support Server](https://discord.gg/c8auE6DFvg) for all questions, suggestions, and assistance!

## üìù To-Do

FlockBot is just getting started, and here are a few things you can expect to see in the near future:
  
  * Bug fixes
  * Code optimisation
  * Suggestions I deem very good.
  * Migrating tickets from channels to private threads
  * Adding channels, roles and bots as logging options
